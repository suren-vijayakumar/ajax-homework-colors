Hello fellow Primates!

In this challenge you will be reading in JSON values via AJAX and reflecting their values on the screen.

## Useful links

jQuery Ajax documentation is [here](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/).

## Assignment!!!

Using the things we've learned about $.ajax(), pull in the JSON list of color names and values. Iterate over our list, creating a new div for each entry. You will append a p tag into each div with the name of the color, and add a CSS class with the color value to the entire div.


### Hard Mode

Add in a local array of colors, and only create your div if the color appears in that list.

**Hint:** var showList = ["red", "cyan", "purple"]

### Pro Mode

Style your application page with Bootstrap, and be sure to optimize for mobile devices (shrink your browser and expand it back and forth to test this).
